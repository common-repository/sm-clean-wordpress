Stable tag: trunk

Replaces special characters in Wordpress title, excerpt, content and comments.

== Description ==

This plugin is heavily based on the &quot;German Permalinks&quot; plugin from Scott Hanson with modifications form Michael Renzmann and Rainer Gerhards. Rainer Gerhards has added the capability to clean the content to HTML entities (e.g. &gt; &amp;uuml;) and I have added more characters and limited the plugin-function only for the Wordpress title, excerpt, content and comments. The plugin works with the default Wordpress editor (tested with Wordpress 2.8+) or Dean's FCKEditor for Wordpress.
